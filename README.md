# holyWorkouts App
The workout app test for holy.
Created in 3 days of sprint based on the resources and my awesome coding skills.

Now i need 3 days of chill :-)

react.js / node.js

how to run:

Shell:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ys-sudo/holyWorkouts.git
```
```
cd holyWorkouts

npm install

yarn

npm run dev

npm run build


```

for build you need a node.js sever.
for dev the preview is live at: **localhost:8080** in your browser.


Either ways i am still working for my previous job until 20th may.
I still got left some svg animations and code corrections to do until that
time.

Then i would be very happy to work for you.

Cheers.

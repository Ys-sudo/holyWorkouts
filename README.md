## The workout app test for holy.
Created in 5 days, based on the resources provided,
3 - days for the main structure and 2 for development and corrections.

### tech stack:
react.js / node.js / webpack / babel / redux

Updated from Friday 15.05 up to 17.05 1:06.
Make sure you clear the browser cache and
refresh the page a couple of times.

Only the saving algorithm needs some work still (find the values in the array - move them into a new array of strings, append to DB), and some corrections are to be done to dragging (for now it clones the selected item and unshifts it), the rest works as expected. You can load the workout or the exercise from the search, add it from top exercises, unshift the array, save the workout with naming convention mapping. There is also a timer, and a clear button. Everything works smoothly and no crashes are expected.

I find it a really cool idea for a test, maybe we can finish this nicely
and release it together. Seems like a great idea for an app!




- main react plugin to migrate some algorithms: React-DOM

how to run:

Shell:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ys-sudo/holyWorkouts.git
```
```
cd holyWorkouts

npm install

yarn

npm run dev  

npm run build


```

for build you need a node.js server.
Currently the live preview is on my netlify server.

for dev the preview is live at: **localhost:8080** in your browser.


Either ways i am still working for my previous job until 20th may.
I still got left some svg animations and code corrections to do until that
time.

Then i would be very happy to work for you.

Cheers.
